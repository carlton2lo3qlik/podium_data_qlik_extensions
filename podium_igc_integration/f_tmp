Level 2 assets - these assets are not as fully marketable as level one, but still sufficiently tradable to have a definite value. Known as mark-to-model, these are estimates based on observable inputs. generally banks have their own valuation models (e.g. price multiple model & further complex ones). Level 3 assets – do not have quoted prices in active markets. They have to be valued by reference to the bank’s own models. Level 3 consists of unobservable inputs, its what market participants would use to price the asset or liability (including risk), using the best information available.
